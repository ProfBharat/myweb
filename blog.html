My Journey from Daily Wager to Assistant Professor My name is Bharat Kumar, from
gopalam vari palem village, chilakaluripeta mandal, Palnadu district , Andhra
Pradesh , India. I was Born in Dalit family of community called Madiga. Our
parents are landless agricultural labourers with four children. Our family was
facing severe poverty, everyday looking for work to earn money for survival.
There was a three year drop out from my schooling , working as a labourer like
cutting trees, climbing palm trees , and other agricultural related works , I
used to work as daily wager along with my parents. When I went to take the
admission the admission for the 8Th class, Teacher asked me "write the english
alphabet" then I could write only A to T. It was very difficult for me in the
High school because I did not know fundamental of the subjects which I was
studying. It was my 8th class when I decided to work hard for my studies , I
took the commitment to study everyday even on holidays too. So started to study
from 4 am to 8 am in our government social welfare hostel. This is really
turning point in my studies, that four hours of regular study was really helpful
me. Started writing and again writing things which I could not understand
properly easily. English was the touch subject for me, so spent more time
learning vocabulary and verb forms, grammar , I could see , certain improvement
in english subject within one year. In my 9th class , I gave the quarterly exam
for english , English teacher called me personally and said that I was the
topper in english subject. Later on, in other subjects also I was getting good
marks. By the end of 9th class I was the one of the class topper. Got many
prizes of quiz competitions in our school, In every quiz competition , I used to
get the first prize only. In our hostel, students often complain about the food,
but in my case It was far better than our home food. I do not get curry at home
regularly. really there were some problems , but I decided to adjust because I
do not have other option. finally I passed the 10th class with good marks , that
made our parents happy. but that happiness did not last longer, because I left
studies after the 10th class. I got good marks in 10th class, still I was
working as daily wager, cutting trees and climbing trees. then i started
thinking I lot about my career . There was no one to guide me . I do not know
proper direction. our parents are illiterates. While cutting the trees , we were
offered alcoholic drinks, like that drinking alcohol became my habit. after one
year of gap , I took admission in polytechnic diploma. Again it was a free
admission , that is a government polytechnic college, I did not face any problem
regarding fee, because it is government college. There I came in contact with
some Christian friends, I was inspired by their way of life style. by looking at
them I learnt reading Bible, Bible reading brought some good changes in my
personal life. I left drinking alcohol, learnt to give respect to others. I am
so thankful to my christian friends who introduced me about Jesus and His
teachings. Polytechnic course also completed easily with good marks. Now tough
times started .... I remember my B.Tech life as dark period, the period of
struggles of poverty. still I cry if I remember those days. I got the admission
in B.Tech college, someone from our village came forward to help financially for
my studies. But some group of Upper Caste community, stopped that help.They say
" Your father is working in our agriculture lands, if we help you financially
for your studies , You will get the the Job. Then who will work in our fields
after your father. Your community people meant for daily wagers, not for jobs".
by saying like this they stopped all my sources of help. My parents cried a lot
, because we do not any sources of help for my studies,I never forget that day
in my life. I thought like My parents are labourers, If I do not go for studies
then me and my generation also will become labourers and slaves. Likewise
generation after generation we will be struggling for survival of life. There
will be no change in our community in the future also if same situation
continues. That day I took a decision at any cost I should complete my B.Tech
degree to escape from this slavery. I felt if I want to help others I need to be
in a good position. I was ready to face the struggles of poverty. Getting ready
for B.Tech admission with tears on my face, No money in my hand. I used to work
for few days at home to earn money , and then I go to the college with that
money. My parents are not able to send me any money , I could 't ask anyone for
money. some times eating and some times not eating. There are some days where I
eat only one meal for a day. I became very thin and weak. When I went my home ,
my parents were crying by looking at my body which was so weak and thin. They
say "stop your studies, do not kill your self in the name of studies". I
recollect that if I do not go for studies , there will be no break in our
slavery and struggles. One day my father saw that I could not lift a 50 kg
fertiliser bag, because my strength has gone from me due to lack of proper food
at the college. After seeing that He again strongly advised me to stop my
studies. I asked my father, if I stop my studies how can we escape from these
struggles, there is no other way except going for studies. Even I myself many
times thought of stoping my studies in the middle of my B.Tech degree. I did not
have money to buy books, then How can I prepare for exams without the book. I
could not find books in the library also because libraries usually have few
number of copies. For writing lab record also , once i did not have money to buy
record sheets for twenty rupees. so I submitted my record with one day lately.
hence I failed in that subject for not submitting my record on time. I conveyed
my situation to him to that professor, but no use. That is my favourite subject
even today but he did not make me pass then. GATE exam preparation to get
scholarship I heard about GATE exam which give scholarship for doing M.Tech , So
then I decided to prepare GATE exam though it is tough for me. Some professors
laughed at me when they knew that I was preparing for GATE. Those professors
were laughing because my percentage of marks was only 52 till 3rd year ending.
But interestingly my project supervisor did not laugh, instead he encouraged me
to prepare for GATE. That was a great help and encounter, for me from my project
supervisor, he is my favourite Professor. He advised me to spend more time in
library for the preparation of Gate exam. I spent around 10 hours per day in the
library. If I don't have money to eat, I used to drink water , again start
reading in the library till the closing time of library.At last I qualified Gate
exam. GATE exam gave me the entry into University of Hyderabad for M.Tech in
Artificial Intelligence. My got matured thinking by studying at this university,
understood the inequality in the society. I gave more priority only for studies.
There was challenge for me in the class room, mostly all of my classmates took
coaching for one or two years for GATE. Because I did not take any coaching , I
felt teachings of the professors difficult for me. There were many sleepless
nights to do the assignments. I could not get more marks , I just passed M.Tech
with second class. Preparation for NET JRF exam after M.Tech I got admission in
Ph.D at IGNTU , a central university in madhya pradesh. I spent around six
months of time for preparation of NET JRF with support of my Ph.D supervisor. I
got the results of NET after six months of writing exam. Finally I cleared NET
exam with JRF. Preparation for AP PSC Degree college lecturer(Assistant
Professor) in 2019 , notification declared, I was in dilemma , they were two
things, ahead to me, one was Ph.D work another was AP PSC job preparation for
Degree college lecturer. I had to select only one of them either Ph.D or Job
preparation. That too there were very few jobs, rarely we get notification for
these jobs. I remembered the financial struggles I was facing at the home , and
I chose to prepare for Degree College Lecturer Job exam. My first supervisor
left the university that was the one of the saddest moments of my life, He is so
kindman towards poor people. I did not get upgradation from JRF to SRF. I lost
the financial support of my one and only JRF scholarship.
